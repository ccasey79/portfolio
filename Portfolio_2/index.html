			<h1>About</h1>
      <p>I've always been involved in technology throughout my career, working originally within
      the post-production and broadcasting industries. In 2016 I diversed into web development and attended
      a bootcamp course which gave me a great insight into how to build websites. I moved into web development
      as I really enjoy the variety of work, each project has it's unique differences. There's always opportunities
      to learn something new and it doesn't become monotonous in it's processes. Working in web development allows
      me to research into new technologies, try out new techniquies and become creative with the designs and processes.
      </p>

      <p>The course I did at General Assembly gave me a great exposure into learning new technologies. Working in teams
      and as an individual gave me excellent experience into pair programming and programming fundamentals. Such technologies
      I gained an understanding of for example are Node.js, version control using Git, using API's and using Frameworks
      incorporating MVC with Angular and Ruby on Rails.</p>

      <p>I'm now currently working for DX2, have been working on a range of client projects. The role is very multi-tasked
        for example I could be changing designs with Adobe Photoshop, coding with HTML, CSS or jQuery or using up to date
        SEO practices for particular sites. Working here I've felt I've learnt so much and gained valuable experience. The
        first four projects below in the portfolio section are examples of my work with DX2.</p>

      <p>If I'm not working with code I love travelling particulary to slightly more unusual places
      like Iceland and Cuba which I have recently visited. I also have a big interest in films, I am regularly at the
      cinema and especially enjoy films by Wes Anderson and Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>

			<h1>Experience</h1>
      <h3>DX2: Junior Web Developer - February 2017 - present</h3>
      <p>I'm currently working here in Northampton. Since I have been working at DX2 I'm regularly working on a variety of
        projects involving client websites and web applications for companies internal use. The company has been a great
        platform for me to learn and improve my skills. Most of my work involves using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Wordpress,
        Adobe Photoshop, Bootstrap, Foundation and SEO. </p>
      <h3>General Assembly: Web Development Immersive - June 2016 - September 2016</h3>
      <p>This was a 3 month immersive bootcamp course in web development. The course provided me with programming fundamentals
        and experience in pair programming. Working with different softwares and processes on both the front-end and back-end of
        development gave me an understanding of how to think and approach problems. The last three projects in the portfolio
        section below were completed from the course, two of which were done individually and one as a group.</p>
      <h3>VocaLink: Internship - Project Manager - July 2011 - February 2012</h3>
      <p>I managed a desktop / mobile application project for this Financial company from initial conceptual ideas to a branded
        application ready to be developed, working within it's digital marketing team. The application was a sort code finder
        which could be used on both the Web and Mobile. This project was as an internship for the dissertation of my MSc
        Electronic Publishing.</p>
